To compile server application:
1. In terminal, go to server folder
2. Input "make" commmand
3. Input "./server" to start server

After starting server:
1. Input frame loss rate(%) (like 0, 10, 20).
2. Input frame corruption rate(%) (like 0, 10, 20).
3. Choose retransmission mode. Input "0" means go-back-N, input "1" means selective repeat.
4. Then server will listen on a certain port waiting for client.



To compile client application:
1. In terminal, go to client folder
2. Input "make" commmand
3. Input "./client" to start client

After starting client:
1. Input frame loss rate(%) (like 0, 10, 20).
2. Input frame corruption rate(%) (like 0, 10, 20).
3. Choose retransmission mode. Input "0" means go-back-N, input "1" means selective repeat.
4. In order to connect to server, input "CONNECT" command, such as "CONNECT <server-hostname>".



After client connects to server, they can communicate with each other. 
During the transmission, frame loss, data corruption and retransmission may happen according to your setting for loss rate, corruption rate and retransmission mode. 
Input "loss rate" to reset new value for loss rate. 
Input "corruption rate" to reset new value for corruption rate.
In order to transfer file, type in "transfer". Then you will be asked to input file name.
Type in "printf", debug information will be displayed on the screen.
